    <p>Running a marathon is a high-intensity, total-body workout, so it is one of the best ways to burn calories and maintain a healthy weight.The event takes place on the road and the finishing order of the race is determined by time. Refuelling stations appear every 5km on a marathon course for the athletes. The course can be looped, out and back or run over multiple laps. Sometimes the finish at a major championships marathon takes place in a stadium.</p>
